Object oriented programming - Assignment 1

This repo is intended to be part of code portfolio, showcasing miscellaneous skills and achievements to potential employers. **This code is not intended for reuse.**

This repo contains code for the first assignment of Object Oriented Programming, a second year module at the Dublin Institute of Technology. The code is written in Scala and uses the [Processing graphics library](https://processing.org/). The assignment is due to be submitted on 29 November 2016.

Below is the opening paragraph of the assignment briefing:
> Use Processing to create a UI for a sci-fi movie device like a warp drive, engines, weapons system. You can base it on any movie you like or come up with your own. It should be kinda usable. It should have lots of animation & interactivity and look amazing. It can be as far out as you like. In other words it can be for an alien. You should use all the stuff you are learning on the course.

My submission is a procedurally generated galactic map, inspired by those found in video games such as Paradox's Stellaris. The map includes multiple levels of depth, with the ability to zoom in and out from a galactic view down to views of individual moons.

The project includes elements of the following:
* Functional object oriented programming
* Domain specific data collections
* Recursive design
* Visibility culling
* Two dimensional cameras / projection
* Collision detection
* Graph theory
* Procedural generation
